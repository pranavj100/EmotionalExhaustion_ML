Predicting the emotional exhaustion of medical students using behavioral factors and machine learning techniques

ABSTRACT:

Medical students undergo high-stress levels, causing unnoticed mental illnesses and burnout. In order to improve the education of medical students and better support health professionals for their careers, this paper works to ascertain poor mental health. This project analyzed visible factors such as empathy, emotional intelligence, and cynicism to predict mental health levels and inform those surrounding medical students of an individualâ€™s potential emotional state. After refurbishing medical student survey data, regression, classification, and neural network models were tested in order to elicit the highest accuracy. Neural networks output the most accurate predictions of emotional exhaustion. The results showed that gender played a minor role in burnout but was not nearly as pronounced as previously analyzed. Cynicism was a prominent indicator of emotional exhaustion, although empathy scores were not indicative. Although machine learning techniques showed promising results, these techniques only provide context and reason to address mental health concerns. However, with the combination of voice analysis, computer vision, and current methods, machine learning could inform treatment plans and provide more information about mental health for medical students.
